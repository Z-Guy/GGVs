This is my version of a chacter select for a fighting game (based on Guilty Gear Strive). I want the user to pick a character and then a opponent and have a winner based on a certain amount
of attacks and the innante strenth of the character. These are my steps:<br />
1)Set up essential files <br />
2)Connect files based on the selected characters <br />
3)Have Program recognize the choosen characters and determine who should win <br />
4)Let the user play again <br />
