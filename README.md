This is my version of a chacter select for a fighting game (based on Guilty Gear Strive). I want the user to pick a character and then a opponent and have a winner based on a certain amount
of attacks and the innante strenth of the character. These are my steps:
1)Set up essential files
2)Connect files based on the selected characters
3)Have Program recognize the choosen characters and determine who should win
4)Let the user play again
